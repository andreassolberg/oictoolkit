# Spec comments

* When the OP processes the client registration request, how is it supposed to validate the request in respect to the MS.
* No appropriate properties to identity the entity for clients, or intermediate providers...
* No way to distinguish a Metadata client statement from a provider statement. No way to restrict a intermediate provider to only clients or providers.
* How to handle localized strings




To check:

* Can client regsitration be signed. How to check signatures there...
